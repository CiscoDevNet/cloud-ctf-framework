## Steps for Registering a new team

1. Pick the AWS account that you want to use.  
Each team will need to have an AWS (free) account. All the challenges can be deployed using free account.  
If you do not have an AWS account, you can [go here and click "create a free account"](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?trk=ps_a134p000003yBfsAAE&trkCampaign=acq_paid_search_brand&sc_channel=ps&sc_campaign=acquisition_US&sc_publisher=google&sc_category=core&sc_country=US&sc_geo=NAMER&sc_outcome=acq&sc_detail=%2Bcreate%20%2Baws%20%2Baccount&sc_content=Account_bmm&sc_segment=438195700997&sc_medium=ACQ-P|PS-GO|Brand|Desktop|SU|AWS|Core|US|EN|Text&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!438195700997!b!!g!!%2Bcreate%20%2Baws%20%2Baccount&ef_id=CjwKCAjw7--KBhAMEiwAxfpkWJwRVjpuXNfVhQxI0idhvMVSlDyY9DXOMGi8kXLUHDo_VEc27lKHrBoCoYsQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!438195700997!b!!g!!%2Bcreate%20%2Baws%20%2Baccount&all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all).

2. Create a new user in the account with security credentials.  
In order for the CTF to be able to deploy challenges to your cloud account, you will need to provide programmatic user credentials to the CTF team when you register a team. The role for the user provided is provided by the CTF team and will have restricted access to only be able to do the actions required by the CTF, which should only be actions that deploy free content (I.e. the CTF team will not deploy something on your account which costs money).  
3. Assign the Role to the user (TBD)
4. Provide the credentials in CTFd app during team registration
