## This is a Offense challenge for challenge 1 which is built. The challenge is exaclty similar to challenge 1 where the only differece is that they do not need to fix any nacl and only need to get the flag which is hidden under ./well-known directory 

The http application gives a html verdict as below 
<p>This is the secure page where only few can access . Below is the secure conversation 
           <br>asd272727: where is the secure doc?
           <br>bgsgsgsgsg: I think only admin can access it
           <br>rfc5785 : I think super admin can access it
           <br>john78567: I cannot find it
           <br>bh76363636: Tell us
